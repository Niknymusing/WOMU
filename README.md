This repository contains the complete Unity C# project implementing the virtual stage, encompassing:
- 3D modelling of 3 different physical live music stages
- Interactive camera control, that can be coordinated in live production with on-stage multi-camera production.
- Multi-input/output livestreaming with 3D rendering in the scene
- Audio-reactive visual elements
- Integrated virtual avatar dance for multiple live dancers, integrating the radical system for online dance in the digital scene.
